# Angular Security Guard

An attempt to implement game logic similar to
[Five Nights at Freddy's](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Five_Nights_at_Freddy%27s)
with AngularJS to practice data binding and views.

My idea is to use Markov chains to drive character location state and
rely on Angular's data binding to update the views. Initially the view(s)
will show all game state data. Eventually I may have user interface,
SVG views and game ticks to allow similar game play to FNAF, but I don't
anticipate implementing sound or fancy graphics or otherwise trying to
make a game people would want to play instead of FNAF. The aim here is
something fun for me to do while learning and practicing Angular.
